    <p>
      <b>Theoretical computer science (TCS)</b> is a subset of general computer
      science and mathematics that focuses on mathematical aspects of computer
      science such as the theory of computation, lambda calculus, and type
      theory.

      It is difficult to circumscribe the theoretical areas precisely. The ACM's
      Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT)
      provides the following description:

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      While logical inference and mathematical proof had existed previously, in
      1931 Kurt Gödel proved with his incompleteness theorem that there are
      fundamental limitations on what statements could be proved or disproved.
    </p>

    <p>
      Information theory was added to the field with a 1948 mathematical theory
      of communication by Claude Shannon. In the same decade, Donald Hebb
      introduced a mathematical model of learning in the brain. With mounting
      biological data supporting this hypothesis with some modification, the
      fields of neural networks and parallel distributed processing were
      established. In 1971, Stephen Cook and, working independently, Leonid
      Levin, proved that there exist practically relevant problems that are
      NP-complete – a landmark result in computational complexity theory[cita

    <h2>Topics</h2>
    <h3>Algorithms</h3>
    <p>
      An algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite list[2] of
      well-defined instructions[3] for calculating a function.[4] Starting from
      an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty),[5] the instructions
      describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite[6]
      number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output"[7]
      and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to
      the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as
      randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.
